# Utilising ruby to create backend service
### GoogleBooksService encapsulates external API logic. BookRatingFetcherJob encapsulates background processing logic.

# Showcasing Backend Development

* RESTful API Design: Clear endpoints for CRUD operations on resources.
* Database Management: Models, migrations, associations with PostgreSQL.
* Validations: Model-level data integrity checks, including custom validations.
* Error Handling: Graceful responses for missing records, invalid input, and external API failures.
* Background Processing: Using ActiveJob for asynchronous tasks (fetching ratings).
* Configuration Management: Secure handling of API keys using Rails credentials.
* Logging: Informative logging for background jobs and API interactions.


External API Integration: Successfully connecting to and parsing data from the Google Books API.
Security Best Practices: Using Rails credentials for sensitive API keys.
